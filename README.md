# Guitar-Tab-Generator
This is a project to develop an Android app that will receive input from the phone microphone, classify the note, and then figure out the "best" way of generating the guitar tablature.

## Motivation

As a guitar player, this sort of app might be useful if you're noodling around with your guitar and stumble upon something interesting. Guitarists are notorious for not being formally trained in music, so there's a sizable crowd that could use it in tab format.

## Usage

I'm still developing it.

Will fill this out once things develop.

## History

1/27 - Working on the engine to return fret candidates based on input notes. Currently using strings to specify input. Next step is to build and traverse a tree based off of the candidate notes.
